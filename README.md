# Javascript List Partitioning 

This is a small function I wrote for a code challenge requested by a potential employer. 

This function and included examples will take a list of integers and returns two lists with integers of equal sums. The initial list can contain any amount of integers, but their sum must be divisible by two for the function to return results.
